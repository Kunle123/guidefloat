# ⏭ Skip Steps Feature

## 🎯 **Problem Solved**

Users have different starting points! Someone who already has a Facebook Business Page set up will see **different screens** than a complete beginner. This feature adapts guides to any experience level.

---

## ✨ **How It Works**

### **For Users:**

When you're on a step you've already completed:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Step 1 of 15  [⏭ SKIPPABLE]       │
│ Set up Facebook Business Manager   │
│                                     │
│ 💡 Already have Business Manager?  │
│    Skip this step.                  │
│                                     │
│ [◀ Previous]  [Skip ⏭]  [Next ▶]  │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Click "Skip"** → Step is marked complete + moves to next step!

## 📝 **For Guide Creators:**

Add these fields to any step in your guide JSON:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "Set up Facebook Business Manager",
  "description": "...",
  "skipIfCompleted": true,
  "skipMessage": "Already have Business Manager? Skip this step.",
  "instructions": "..."
}
```

### **Fields:**

- **`skipIfCompleted`** (boolean): Set to `true` to make step skippable

```
Step 1 of 15  [⏭ SKIPPABLE]
```
- Yellow badge shows skippable steps at a glance

### **2. Info Box in Step Body**
```

│ 💡 Already have Business Manager?   │
│    Skip this step.                   │
└──────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### **3. Skip Button in Footer**
```
[◀ Previous]  [Skip ⏭]  [Next ▶]
```
- Orange "Skip" button appears only on skippable steps
- Tooltip shows the skip message

---

## 🔧 **What Happens When You Skip:**

1. **Marks step as completed** ✓
2. **Moves to next step** →
3. **Saves progress** automatically
4. **Updates progress bar** (just like completing normally)

---

## 📚 **Example: Facebook Ads Guide**

**Step 1:** "Set up Facebook Business Manager"  
→ **Skippable** if you already have it

**Step 2:** "Connect Your Facebook Page"  
→ **Skippable** if you already have a page connected

**Step 3:** "Create Ad Account"  
→ Not skippable (everyone needs this)

---

## 💡 **Use Cases**

### **1. Different Experience Levels**
- Beginners: Follow all steps
- Intermediate: Skip setup steps
- Advanced: Skip to specific actions

### **2. Different Account States**
- New user: "Create account" steps required
- Existing user: "Create account" steps skippable

### **3. Optional Steps**
- Mark steps as skippable if they're nice-to-have
- Users can skip if they want to come back later

---

## 🚀 **Benefits**

✅ **Flexible guides** - adapt to any user  
✅ **Faster completion** - skip what you don't need  
✅ **Better UX** - no confusion about irrelevant steps  
✅ **Same guide, all users** - no need for multiple versions

## 📊 **When to Make Steps Skippable**

### **✅ Good Candidates:**

- Account setup steps (if user might have account)
- Initial configuration (if might be done)
- Optional features
- Prerequisites that vary by user

### **❌ Don't Make Skippable:**

- Core actions everyone must do
- Steps that build on each other
- Final submission/completion steps
