# 🎯 Smart UX Features - Reducing Page Obstruction

GuideFloat now includes several intelligent features to minimize obstruction while you browse.

---

## ✨ **What's New:**

### 1. **Auto-Opacity Fade** 💨
**The Problem:** Widget blocks content even when not actively using it.

**The Solution:** 
- Widget is **75% opacity** by default (semi-transparent)
- **100% opacity** when you hover or interact with it
- Smooth transitions make it feel natural

**How it works:**
```
Idle → 75% visible (see through it!)
Hover/Click → 100% visible (fully readable)
```

---

### 2. **Peek Mode** ⚡
**The Problem:** Full widget takes up too much space.

**The Solution:** 
- Click the **⚡ button** or press **ESC** to collapse to a slim 60px sidebar
- Shows just the header and buttons
- Hover to see it's still there
- Click ⚡ again or press ESC to expand

**Perfect for:**
- Reading long articles
- Filling out forms
- Focusing on content while keeping guide accessible

---

### 3. **Bottom-Right Positioning** 📍
**The Problem:** Center of screen blocks main content.

**The Solution:**
- Widget now starts in **bottom-right corner**
- Less intrusive positioning
- Still fully draggable anywhere you want

---

### 4. **Keyboard Shortcuts** ⌨️
**The Problem:** Need to click to interact.

**The Solution:**
- **ESC** - Toggle peek mode instantly
- Works from anywhere on the page (except when typing in inputs)

**Pro Tip:** 
```
Reading article → Press ESC → Widget shrinks to slim bar
Need guide again → Press ESC → Widget expands
```

## 🎨 **Visual Feedback:**

### Opacity States:
- **Idle:** 75% opacity + subtle shadow
- **Hover:** 100% opacity + stronger shadow
- **Peek Mode:** 60% opacity + compact 60px width

### Transitions:
- All changes are smooth and animated
- No jarring movements
- Feels polished and professional
