# 🎨 UX Improvements - Guide State & Navigation

## Issues Fixed

### ❌ Issue 1: Unclear Close Behavior
**Problem:** Users didn't know if closing meant:
- Guide is hidden (can bring back)
- Guide is reset (starts fresh)
- Progress is lost

### ❌ Issue 2: "Go to Guide" Doesn't Show Widget
**Problem:** Clicking "Go to Guide →" switched tabs but widget stayed hidden/minimized

---

## ✅ Solutions Implemented

### 1. Clear Close Confirmation

**Before:**
- Click "Close Guide"
- Guide disappears
- No feedback about what happened

**After:**
```
Click "Close Guide" →

┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ Close "Facebook Ads Setup"?     │
│                                  │
│ This will:                       │
│ ✗ Close the guide overlay       │
│ ✗ Keep your progress saved      │
│                                  │
│ You can restart anytime by       │
│ selecting the guide again.       │
│                                  │
│ [Cancel] [OK]                    │
└─────────────────────────────────┘

After closing:
✓ Guide closed. Your progress is saved!
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Clear about what happens
- ✅ Confirms progress is saved
- ✅ Explains how to restart
- ✅ Gives feedback after action

### 2. "Go to Guide" Actually Shows Widget

**Before:**
```
Click "Go to Guide →"
↓
Tab switches
↓
Widget still minimized/hidden ❌
```

**After:**
```
Click "Go to Guide →"
↓
Tab switches
↓
Widget automatically shown & maximized ✅
↓
Popup closes
```

**What happens now:**
1. Switches to the tab with the guide
2. Sends `showWidget` message to content script
3. Widget un-minimizes if needed
4. Widget becomes visible
5. Popup closes automatically

**Error handling:**
- If tab was closed → Clear message + reset state
- If widget doesn't respond → Logs for debugging

### 3. Better Status Messages

**Throughout the popup:**

| Action | Message |
|--------|---------|
| Close guide | ✓ Guide closed. Your progress is saved! |
| Tab closed | Tab was closed. Click a guide to restart. |
| Active guide | ✓ [Guide Name] - Active guide |
