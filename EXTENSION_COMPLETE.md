## 💡 Why This Is Better

**The bookmarklet had a fundamental flaw** - browser security prevents JavaScript from persisting across navigation.

**The extension solves this** by using Chrome's content script API, which is specifically designed for this use case.

Now GuideFloat can truly deliver its promise: **guides that stay with you wherever you go.**
